## Markdown Previewer

### Description
A simple React markdown previewer. By default it is populated with multiple examples, but is responsive to new inputs.

### Details
Originally created using React on CodePen for freeCodeCamp curriculum, the pen can be found at this location: https://codepen.io/simonC137/pen/gOogggR. My original code is all in the src folder.
